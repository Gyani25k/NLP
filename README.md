# NLP Analysis System

This repository contains an NLP Analysis System that supports processing both structured and unstructured data in real-time and non-real-time modes.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Built with React, allowing users to input data and see results via a web interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python with Flask to handle NLP requests. Supports real-time updates using Socket.IO.
- **NLP Capabilities**: Processes structured data using Pandas, and performs text analysis using SpaCy, NLTK, and Transformers.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3 and pip

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

### Backend Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`

## Usage
- The application allows input of structured and unstructured data for NLP processing. Real-time results are available through the web interface.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/process-structured`: Accepts POST requests with structured data in JSON format.
  - `/process-unstructured`: Accepts POST requests with unstructured text data in JSON format.

## Deployment
- Use Docker or a similar tool for containerization to ease deployment.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
